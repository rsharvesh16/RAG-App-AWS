Symbolic reasoning is a form of artificial intelligence that uses formal symbols to represent and manipulate information. It's a type of reasoning that is often used in logic, mathematics, and computer science. The goal is to create systems that can understand, reason, and draw conclusions based on formal symbols and rules.

In the context of the provided text, the authors are discussing the use of chain-of-thought prompting in language models for symbolic reasoning tasks, specifically arithmetic reasoning. They found that the performance gain from this approach is largest when dealing with challenging multi-step problems where the scaling curve is relatively flat. This is because these problems require a more complex reasoning process, which is better suited to the chain-of-thought method.

The authors also mention that while they focused on multi-step reasoning tasks in their study, chain-of-thought prompting could potentially be applied to any task for which humans use a "chain of thought
